# ScanFolder

This script exposes a VB Script class to scan a folder structure and retrieve files with specific extensions (like, for instance : xls, xlsx, xlsm).

The list of files will be outputted in a text file so that list can be 
used in a separate process.

See [../test/retrieve_excel.vbs](../test/retrieve_excel.vbs) for an example script.
